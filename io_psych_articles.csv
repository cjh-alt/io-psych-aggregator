Journal of Business and Psychology,Strengthening Workplace Connections through Coworker Socializing and Managerial Support for Fun,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-026-10108-0,2026-02-27,"<p>This study examines how coworker socializing—informal, non-task interactions among colleagues—shapes employees’ attachment to coworkers and interpersonal citizenship behavior. Drawing on conservation of resources (COR) theory, we propose that coworker socializing functions as a social/conditional resource that increases employees’ daily vitality, which in turn strengthens constituent attachment and interpersonal citizenship behavior. We further argue that manager support for fun operates as a resource passageway that amplifies the positive association between coworker socializing and vitality. Using an experience sampling design with 121 hospitality employees across 10 workdays, results support the hypothesized mediation and moderated mediation effects. This study advances workplace fun research by clarifying vitality as a proximal mechanism linking everyday socializing to relational and prosocial outcomes, and it extends COR theory by showing how managerial support shapes the translation of social resources into personal energy and downstream attachment and helping.</p>","AI/Technology, Conflict, Leadership, Organisational Development & Design",10.1007/s10869-026-10108-0
Journal of Business and Psychology,Work Precarity and Workplace Surveillance Experiences,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-026-10105-3,2026-02-26,"<p>Electronic performance monitoring (EPM) is increasingly used to track workers’ behaviors, often without their input or consent. While prior research has documented mixed effects of EPM on stress and performance, these outcomes must be understood in the broader context of work precarity. Drawing on a nationally representative survey of US workers (<i>N</i> = 2515), we examine how structural and psychological precarity relate to both the presence and perceived intrusiveness of EPM. Results show that precarious workers are more likely to be subjected to EPM, to experience more intensive monitoring, and to report more negative psychological reactions to surveillance. Positive perceptions of EPM, such as beliefs that it improves safety or productivity, were more common among workers with greater security and control. These findings suggest that EPM functions not only as a technological intervention but also as a mechanism reflecting and reinforcing existing power imbalances in the workplace. The discussion considers implications for psychological theory, regulation, and policy, highlighting the need for equitable implementation of monitoring practices in an era of increasing workplace surveillance.</p>","Organisational Development & Design, Performance/Productivity, Safety, Turnover/Burnout",10.1007/s10869-026-10105-3

Journal of Business and Psychology,Losing Control of My Career Trajectory: The Role of Career Insecurity and Supervisor Mentoring Support in Shaping Employee Withdrawal and Mental Health,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-026-10103-5,2026-02-17,"<p>Artificial intelligence technologies’ rapid advancement, alongside global economic instability, has heightened labor market uncertainty, making career insecurity a prevalent issue. However, understanding how employees cope with career insecurity and sustain healthy careers remains limited. Grounded in the transactional model of stress, this study posits that career insecurity, as a career-related stressor, triggers perceived control loss, which, in turn, increases job withdrawal and impairs mental health. Furthermore, we examine supervisor career support mentoring as a critical situational factor influencing employees’ appraisals of and responses to career insecurity. Using three-wave data collected from two different occupational settings—emerging gig work and traditional service work—we find that career insecurity is positively associated with perceived control loss, which subsequently motivates job withdrawal and damages mental health. Notably, supervisor career support mentoring mitigates the indirect effects of career insecurity on job withdrawal and mental health through its impact on perceived control loss. Our research contributes to the career insecurity literature by offering a theory-based explanation of its influence on key career outcomes. Practically, it provides valuable insights for managers to mitigate career insecurity’s adverse effects and promote healthier, more sustainable careers among employees.</p>","AI/Technology, Coaching, Leadership, Organisational Development & Design, Turnover/Burnout, Wellbeing",10.1007/s10869-026-10103-5

Journal of Occupational Health Psychology,Beyond positivity: A review of the functional outcomes of negative emotions at work.,http://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000422,2026-02-12,"Organizational scholars examining the effects of emotions on employees generally assume that negative emotions produce negative outcomes. However, a nascent body of research challenges this view, suggesting that negative emotions can help employees navigate work demands arising from disruptive external events. We draw on the COVID-19 pandemic—a salient, prolonged event that stimulated widespread negative emotions—as a theoretically meaningful context to explore when and why negative emotions may yield beneficial outcomes. Specifically, we provide an integrative conceptual review synthesizing research from applied and social psychology conducted during the pandemic that identifies two pathways through which negative emotions produce functional individual-level outcomes at work. The first pathway captures direct effects driven by the unique action tendencies associated with discrete negative emotions. The second pathway, informed by the personality systems interaction theory, highlights contingent effects shaped by self-regulatory factors and external support from leaders, teams, or organizational policies. Our findings challenge and extend discrete emotion and affective shift theories by detailing how and under what conditions negative emotions from disruptive events can have functional outcomes. We bring necessary nuance to prevailing emotion theories and offer practical implications for leaders and organizations seeking to manage negative emotions during the times of hardship.

Consulting Psychology Journal,Leading in perpetual whitewater: Roles leaders can play.,http://doi.org/10.1037/cpb0000310,2026-02-05,"In today’s era of perpetual whitewater leaders face turbulence, complexity, and ambiguity that demand new capabilities for leading change and supporting their organizations’ overall change capability. This article synthesizes existing literature on building sustainable change capability through leadership. It is organized around five roles leaders can play: As navigators, leaders scan environments, interpret signals, and provide real-time navigation through situational awareness and sensemaking. As learning guides, they model and nurture curiosity, developmental readiness, and learning agility while orchestrating cultures where experimentation and reflection drive collective growth. As pilots, leaders compassionately guide people through the human side of change, reducing friction, by helping them process uncertainty, align diverse perspectives, and co-create shared meaning. As engineers, leaders design systems, structures, and distributed leadership practices that balance stability with agility, embedding adaptability into the fabric of the organization. Finally, as stabilizers, leaders steady their teams by demonstrating versatility, emotional agility, self-care, and boundary setting, providing microstability that complements organizational agility. Together, these roles highlight the paradoxical demands of modern leadership—balancing stability and flexibility, force and enablement, and learning and performance. Consultants and coaches can support leaders in understanding and cultivating these capacities and as a result help leaders both guide organizations through disruption but also embed resilience, adaptability, and trust as enduring capabilities for thriving in a world of constant change.

The article focuses on the need for faster and more effective change outcomes and leadership perceptions of change outcomes and change fatigue. Solutions to build ongoing ability to respond to change and successfully pivot are outlined in categories of “people and capability” and “process and tools.” Change-ready mindsets and best practices for change networks are identified. Emphasis is placed on articulating clear, compelling change visions; adopting expansive mindsets about uncertainty; and creating responsive stakeholder feedback loops and decision-making frameworks. Suggestions are made for an agile change approach that focuses on creating the conditions within which change can thrive and sparking change momentum versus simply trying to manage change. Practical ideas are shared to combat change fatigue and establish enterprise change infrastructure for repeatable change success.

That is, in part, because human change is a complex system. Sustained, desired change is possible by recognizing and using the multilevel context of any change, whether individual, team, organization, community, or country. Intentional change theory provides a fractal theory of sustained, desired change within each level and a more enduring sustained, desired change across levels. The multilevel intentional change theory is described with a brief review of empirical evidence within the framework of complexity concepts. Using concepts from complex systems, this paper discusses implications for improved research and practice.

Consulting Psychology Journal,Thriving during turbulent times: The role of consulting psychologists in building change capability.,http://doi.org/10.1037/cpb0000308,2026-02-05,"Given the increasing regularity of organizational change, there is a growing demand for organizations to build the capability needed to navigate constant change and maintain alignment with the evolving business environment. The complexity of today’s business context highlights the inadequacies of traditionally top-down and linear change management models, underscoring the need for more adaptable and resilient approaches. This article defines the construct of organizational change capability, traces its origin to strategic management, reviews existing empirical findings, discusses its relationships with other organizational change models and concepts, and identifies areas where psychological theories can further advance research and practice. It then introduces the articles in this special issue, emphasizing the pivotal role that change practitioners, particularly consulting psychologists, can play in developing sustainable change capability at different levels of the organization. The underlying hope of this special issue is to stimulate more scholarly investigations into the psychological and behavioral foundations of organizational change capability and offer practical guidance for organizations and business leaders striving to adapt and thrive in an increasingly volatile business environment.

Journal of Business and Psychology,A Meta-Analytic Investigation on the Construct Validity of Risk Propensity at Work: Insights from Decision Science and Large Language Models,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-026-10102-6,2026-01-30,"<p>Risk propensity is a central construct in personality, economic, and decision sciences, but its predictive utility in a work context remains underexplored. In this paper, we integrate psychometric meta-analysis with decision modeling to examine the construct validity of risk propensity for work. We also use a large language model (LLM) approach to examine how semantic representations of specific decision attributes (e.g., potential gains, losses, and uncertainty) reflected in survey items map onto the observed meta-analytic relationships between risk propensity and work behaviors. We found that risk propensity outperformed most Big Five traits, the dominant model of personality at work, in uniquely predicting various constructive (e.g., creativity, constructive deviance) and destructive (e.g., counterproductivity, safety non-compliance) work performance constructs above and beyond the Big Five. Using sentence transformers, we found that outcome item embeddings were highly predictive of the meta-analytic correlations between risk propensity and work outcomes. Meta-regression using LLM-derived decision attributes revealed that the relationship between risk propensity and work performance was stronger for behaviors that involve greater personal risk (e.g., safety non-compliance) and positive organizational valence (e.g., creativity). Together, this paper expands the constellation of workplace predictors while advancing a novel methodological approach that combines modern LLMs with decision modeling to test the theoretical underpinnings of trait-behavior relationships.</p>","AI/Technology, Assessment, Creativity, Meta-Analysis, Organisational Development & Design, Performance/Productivity, Personality, Safety",10.1007/s10869-026-10102-6
Journal of Business and Psychology,The Buffering Role of Religiosity in Mitigating the Negative Effects of Eldercare Burden on Employee Exhaustion and Job Outcomes: Insights from Pakistani Organizations,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-026-10098-z,2026-01-30,"<p>The aging population presents a significant challenge, bringing with it the additional burden of informal eldercare. In this study, we explore how this eldercare burden spills over into the workplace, affecting caregivers’ job outcomes. Specifically, we investigate how employees’ eldercare responsibilities undermine their in-role performance, interpersonal citizenship behavior (OCB-I), and creativity through mental and physical exhaustion. Additionally, we also examine how religiosity, as a personal resource, can help mitigate these negative effects. To test our predictions, we conducted two field surveys in several organizations across different sectors. The findings of both studies indicate that employees’ eldercare burden negatively affects their in-role performance, OCB-I, and creativity. Mediation analysis reveals that this detrimental impact is due to increased mental and physical exhaustion. However, strong religiosity beliefs can mitigate the negative effects of eldercare burden on mental and physical exhaustion. Finally, the results also confirm a moderated mediation effect: religiosity buffers the indirect negative impact of eldercare burden on work outcomes. These findings are discussed considering their implications for theory and practice.</p>","Creativity, Conflict, Organisational Development & Design, Performance/Productivity, Turnover/Burnout",10.1007/s10869-026-10098-z

Journal of Business and Psychology,Making Sense of Claims of Unfairness: Third-Party Overall Fairness Perceptions Negatively Affect Claim Veracity and Deontic Reactions,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-025-10097-6,2026-01-29,"<p>Research supporting the deontic model of justice demonstrates that employees experience anger at the mistreatment of coworkers and seek to restore justice on their behalf. However, this research has focused on situations in which third parties know what happened in the incident, such as when they witness the mistreatment. In contrast, when third parties receive a <i>claim</i> of unfairness, they lack knowledge about what happened and may question the veracity of the claim, thereby attenuating their deontic reactions. We integrate the deontic model of justice with fairness heuristic theory to predict that third parties’ overall fairness perceptions will serve as a lens through which claims of unfairness are interpreted. Perceptions of one’s organization as generally fair will be negatively related to perceived claim veracity, which in turn reduces third-party anger and the desire to restore justice. In two preregistered studies (<i>N</i>s = 286 and 394) using a complementary mix of correlational and experimental designs, we found support for our hypotheses. We also show that the negative indirect effect of overall fairness perceptions on third-party reactions is attenuated when the claim is corroborated. In total, the current research highlights the pivotal role of perceived claim veracity in explaining third-party reactions to claims of unfairness. More broadly, it suggests that holding the view of one’s organization as generally fair may have paradoxical effects by reducing third-party support for another member of the organization who has experienced unfairness.</p>","AI/Technology, Justice, Organisational Development & Design",10.1007/s10869-025-10097-6
Journal of Business and Psychology,Brittle Through the Ripple Effect of Disrespect? Stress Sensitization from Experienced Workplace Incivility,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-026-10099-y,2026-01-28,"<p>This study investigates stress sensitization in a work context. Integrating stress-as-offense-to-self theory into stress sensitization, we argue that workplace incivility experienced in the past relates to heightened stress reactivity to various current stressors (i.e., workplace incivility, quantitative stressors, work-related hassles, and a laboratory stressor), with lower self-efficacy explaining these effects. To test these assumptions, we conducted a four-week weekly study with 314 employees, of whom 58 additionally participated in the laboratory-based Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). Stress reactivity was measured via negative affect in the weekly surveys and psychological distress as well as heart rate in the TSST. Hypotheses were tested using mediated-moderation analyses for the weekly data and latent growth modelling combining the weekly with the TSST data. Results showed that incivility experienced throughout the first three weeks related to stronger psychological stress reactivity to incivility, quantitative stressors and work-related hassles in week four. Self-efficacy partially mediated this moderation effect. In addition, past workplace incivility related to a stronger psychological but not physiological stress reactivity to the TSST. In sum, these results support the assumptions of stress sensitization and show that past workplace incivility positively relates to psychological vulnerability across a range of current stressors.</p>","AI/Technology, Organisational Development & Design, Turnover/Burnout",10.1007/s10869-026-10099-y

Journal of Business and Psychology,In the Blink of an AI: Exploring Large Language Models’ Capability to Infer Traits From LinkedIn,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10869-025-10087-8,2026-01-20,"<p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly promoted to practitioners as tools for inferring personality traits from LinkedIn profiles, promising scalable and innovative assessments. Yet, the psychometric foundations of such inferences remain untested. Building on the lens model, we presented 406 LinkedIn profiles to Microsoft Copilot (powered by GPT-4) twice, using single-shot prompting to assess personality (Big Five, narcissism) and intelligence. Inferences showed satisfactory intra-rater reliability for observable traits (up to <i>r</i> = .81), but poor reliability for less visible traits, suggesting unstable inferences (as low as<i> r</i> = .31). Correlations with ground-truth test scores indicate above-chance yet limited convergent validity for intelligence (<i>r</i> = .24), openness (<i>r</i> = .20), and extraversion (<i>r</i> = .20), but not for less visible traits. Analysis of 32 coded LinkedIn cues suggests that this above-chance convergence reflects Copilot drawing on LinkedIn information with some consistency and sensitivity to valid trait signals. While this suggests a rudimentary functional grasp of personality, inferences were undermined by serious flaws, including positivity bias, range restriction, poor discriminant validity, cue overgeneralization, and adverse demographic impacts. By extending the lens model to LLMs as perceivers, we offer a theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding LLM-based trait inferences. Overall, claims that LLMs can validly infer personality from LinkedIn profiles are not just overoptimistic, but potentially harmful—they risk encouraging the adoption of practices that could lead to invalid selection decisions, unfair treatment of applicants, and legal exposure for organizations.

This study develops and validates the Intervention and Multiphase Training Transfer Assessment Questionnaire, designed specifically to capture contextual elements, transfer mechanisms, and behavioral outcomes across the implementation phases of occupational health psychology training interventions. We tested the Intervention and Multiphase Training Transfer Assessment Questionnaire’s psychometric properties, convergent and discriminant validity, and predictive validity using data from a large multinational, multiwave study across 10 organizations (<em>N</em> = 1,966 at T1) in five European countries, with data collected over six time points. Results demonstrated (a) strong psychometric properties, including robust factor structure and temporal reliability, (b) convergent and discriminant validity with expected relationships between subscales, and (c) predictive validity showing that pretraining contextual constructs and training experiences predicted posttraining integration and well-being outcomes. The Intervention and Multiphase Training Transfer Assessment Questionnaire provides a validated tool for systematically assessing training transfer across temporal phases (pretraining, during training, and posttraining integration), enabling researchers and practitioners to evaluate the contextual constructs and mechanisms that facilitate successful workplace learning integration in occupational health psychology interventions.

Journal of Occupational Health Psychology,Take control: A two-study evaluation of a self-regulation intervention with randomized controlled trials.,http://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000418,2026-01-12,"The way in which people work is changing, with workplaces characterized by greater variations in <em>where, when,</em> and<em> how</em> people work. Across two studies, we evaluated a web-based intervention introducing self-regulation strategies based on Action Regulation Theory to enable workers in hybrid working environments to organize their workday effectively, to manage work and private life demands, and thus to improve work performance (indicated by task performance and proactivity), occupational self-efficacy, and psychological detachment and reduce work–life conflict. In two randomized controlled trials, participants were assigned to an intervention group or a waitlist control group, filling out questionnaires before and after the intervention. In Study 1, using a randomized controlled trial with a convenience sample of 128 German employees (intervention group: <em>n</em> = 65; control group: <em>n</em> = 64) with baseline and two follow-up measurement points, multilevel analyses revealed positive effects on occupational self-efficacy, task performance, and proactivity. Moreover, we found a delayed effect on both work–life conflict and detachment after 2 weeks. In Study 2, in a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 125 Irish employees from one organization (intervention group: <em>n</em> = 59; control group: <em>n</em> = 66), we found positive effects directly after the intervention on occupational self-efficacy and work–life conflict. The results of both studies converge to support the effectiveness of the developed self-regulation intervention. Findings suggest that the intervention is an effective tool for promoting certain aspects of work performance. Furthermore, training self-regulation in the work context can improve occupational self-efficacy and reduce work–life conflict.

Much of this attention has focused on identifying and refining statistical techniques for testing mediation effects models or for the estimation of indirect effects and their confidence intervals. However, several scholars have argued that because mediation is about identifying theoretical (causal) mechanisms transmitting the effects of independent variables on dependent variables, researchers should focus more on study designs that improve the ability to make strong causal inferences and reduce the possibility that confounding variables account for the observed mediating effects. This paper provides a review of management and applied psychology articles reporting three experimental approaches to testing mediation: measurement-of-mediation (MOM), experimental-causal-chain (ECC), and moderation-of-process (MOP). Our review of 160 articles reporting 310 distinct studies indicates that there is a substantial amount of variance in the application of these techniques, and that some of the research designs being implemented limit appropriate causal inferences.

Yet, we know little about which and how interns do so. Drawing on the job demands-resources (JD-R) theory, we propose career adaptivity as a personal resource that drives job crafting, and its effects on well-being outcomes (thriving and depletion) among interns. We investigate the three distinct job crafting behaviors as elaborated through the JD-R lens; we further introduce the concept of job crafting consistency, above and beyond the widely explored idea of job crafting level. Using a 10-day diary methodology that measures both job crafting levels (mean) and consistency (variance) of the three distinct job crafting behaviors, we examine these relationships at the between-individual level with 760 daily observations of interns in China. Results revealed that career adaptive interns engaged in higher levels of seeking resources and challenges, subsequently experiencing greater thriving. While career adaptivity did not predict job crafting consistency, our findings uncover a distinct relationship between consistency and depletion; consistently reducing demands increased depletion. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.</p>","AI/Technology, Job Design, Organisational Development & Design, Wellbeing",10.1007/s10869-025-10093-w

This study used an experimental simulation design to examine how political value similarity may influence hiring decisions, focusing on France's polarized multi-party system with a centrist core. This allowed us to compare fictional applicants with extreme political affiliations with those with moderate or neutral stances. We also analyzed raters' reasons for evaluating politically affiliated fictional candidates and how these evaluations impacted hypothetical hiring outcomes. A sample of 350 raters assessed a fictional LinkedIn profile with manipulated political affiliation. Findings showed that political value similarity heightened perceptions of overall similarity, which was associated with hypothetical hiring outcomes such as expected counterproductive work behavior (CWB): Sharing political values reduced expectations of CWB. Notably, over 20% of participants cited political considerations as the key factors when evaluating fictional applicants who openly shared their political affiliation on LinkedIn. Future research should thus distinguish between different party affiliations as these can exhibit unique effects on hiring outcomes.</p>","Culture, Diversity/Inclusion, Organisational Development & Design, Selection/Recruitment",10.1007/s10869-025-10096-7
Journal of Occupational Health Psychology,Dehumanized yet agentic? When and how organizational dehumanization mediates the effects of abusive supervision on burnout and interpersonal helping behavior.,http://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000419,2025-12-18,"Drawing from the dehumanization model and human agency theory, we examined the psychological processes underlying the relations of abusive supervision with employees’ well-being (i.e., burnout) and performance (i.e., interpersonal helping behavior), through the sequential mediation of organizational dehumanization (OD), (in)authenticity and powerlessness, and the moderation of employee chronic self-efficacy. We tested our hypotheses in a three-wave time-lagged study with supervisor–employee dyads in China (Study 1, <em>N</em> = 203 dyads) and a four-wave longitudinal study in North America (Study 2, <em>N</em> = 314). Results from both studies supported all of our hypotheses. OD mediated the relations of abusive supervision with employee burnout and interpersonal helping. Furthermore, OD and inauthenticity serially mediated the relation between abusive supervision and employees’ burnout, whereas OD and powerlessness serially mediated the relation between abusive supervision and employee interpersonal helping behavior. Employees’ chronic self-efficacy moderates the serial mediating effects of OD in the relationship of abusive supervision with burnout and interpersonal helping behavior. The current research extends the dehumanization theory (Haslam, 2006) through the lens of human agency (Bandura, 1989), furthering our understanding on OD processes. It also expands the theoretical understanding on abusive supervision through introducing OD as a critical mediational mechanism and examining human-agency-related mediational and moderational mechanisms, above and beyond past literature focused on resource- and justice-related theoretical processes.

This is oversimplified, as many individuals are embedded in a dual-earner household. Additionally, the perspectives of men and women are likely to be unique, given societal expectations regarding household contributions to income. Along those lines, drawing from social role theory, we investigate the joint effects of dual-earners’ considerations of money as an indicator of success and achievement (i.e., money as achievement) on the male partner’s person-job, needs-supplies fit. Our findings support two hypotheses: men’s needs-supplies fit increases as their perceptions of money as achievement become more congruent with their female partners’ perceptions and men’s needs-supplies fit increases as congruence is obtained at higher levels (opposed to lower levels). Notably, results also indicated a curvilinear effect such that men’s needs-supplies fit is lowest when congruence is obtained at moderate levels. Importantly, as expected, these congruence/incongruence effects are not present when evaluating women’s needs-supplies fit. Theoretical and practical implications specific to dual-earners’ interdependence, gender roles, and dyadic perspectives on money-related attitudes are discussed.</p>","AI/Technology, Organisational Development & Design",10.1007/s10869-025-10094-9

Journal of Occupational Health Psychology,Revisiting the stressor–burnout relationship: Evidence for reverse causation and conditional change.,http://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000417,2025-12-08,"The assumption that work stressors cause burnout is central to many occupational health theories. In this study, we addressed three limitations in prior research: (a) the limited understanding of how within-person increases in work stressors drive increases in burnout (the stressor hypothesis), including the consideration of whether the reverse effect (the strain hypothesis) offers greater predictive value; (b) the limited research on varying long-term time lags in the development of burnout; and (c) the limited evaluation of the effects of multiple work stressors. We applied random-intercept cross-lagged panel models with different time lags to analyze data from 2,131 German-speaking employees, collected across five time points over 24 months. Our findings showed stronger support for the strain hypothesis, suggesting that an increase in burnout over 6 months results in a subsequent increase in work stressors. This finding remained consistent across three types of stressors (i.e., work overload, social stressors, and organizational stressors) and when accounting for additional longer term time lags. We found limited evidence for the stressor hypothesis, particularly when disregarding stable between-person differences. However, cross-level moderation analyses showed that work stressors resulted in increased burnout for individuals who experience chronically lower levels of job resources (i.e., job autonomy and social support) or higher levels of work stressors. Our findings challenge the unconditional applicability of the stressor effect. They emphasize the theoretical importance of considering reverse causation, the timing of effects, and a clearer distinction between within-person changes and between-person differences to advance the understanding of burnout development processes.

Drawing on affective events theory, appraisal theory, and self-conscious emotions literature, we explore the antecedent work events that trigger guilt and pride through open-ended responses from 329 employed adults. We then examine how guilt and pride influence emotional exhaustion, withdrawal, and engagement, with perceived supervisor support as a moderator, using an experience sampling study with 151 employees. We found that negative and positive performance, social, and moral events were significantly associated with daily guilt and pride, respectively. Daily guilt was associated with more withdrawal, whereas pride was linked to reduced exhaustion and boosted engagement. Notably, the buffering effect of pride on emotional exhaustion was stronger when supervisor support was high. These findings advance organizational behavior and self-conscious emotions literature by identifying key antecedent work events triggering guilt and pride and demonstrating that employees’ guilt or pride elicited from violating or meeting their identity-related goals shape their daily (dis)engaging responses. Practical implications are discussed, highlighting the role of supportive supervisors and daily workplace practices.</p>","AI/Technology, Leadership, Motivation, Organisational Development & Design, Performance/Productivity, Turnover/Burnout",10.1007/s10869-025-10092-x

Journal of Occupational Health Psychology,Trajectories of psychological detachment over the weekend: Investigating antecedents and outcomes.,http://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000416,2025-12-04,"This study examined whether there are distinct trajectories of psychological detachment from work over the weekend and how these trajectories relate to fatigue, sleep impairment, and engagement at the start of the following week. It also examined weekly fluctuations in supplemental work and problem-solving conversations as potential predictors of different trajectories. A sample of 153 employees reported their daily levels of detachment at bedtime from Friday to Sunday across up to four weekends, yielding a total of 421 weekends. Supplemental work and problem-solving conversations were assessed on Fridays, while fatigue and sleep impairment were measured on Monday mornings, and engagement on Mondays after work. Latent class growth analysis identified three distinct trajectories of detachment: (a) increasing high detachment (49%), (b) increasing medium detachment (35%), and (c) consistent low detachment (16%). While weekly fluctuations in problem-solving conversations only distinguished between the increasing high and consistent low trajectories, employees’ average levels in supplemental work and problem-solving conversations distinguished the increasing high trajectory from the other two trajectories. After weekends with an increasing medium detachment trajectory, engagement was higher than after weekends with an increasing high trajectory. Sleep impairment and fatigue did not differ between different trajectories. While the sample was predominantly female and highly educated, limiting generalizability, the study provides valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of psychological detachment from work that occur over weekends, underscoring the need for further research with more diverse samples.

To answer this question, we built on the energy management perspective of play to investigate the direct, configurational, and multiplicative effects of playful work design (consisting of designing fun and designing competition) on work engagement and workaholism. We proposed that playful work design represents an effective energy management strategy for work engagement, but may also increase workaholism when designing competition overshadows designing fun. We tested our hypotheses and replicated our findings in two heterogeneous samples. Specifically, we conducted a cross-sectional (Study 1; <i>N</i> = 1262) and daily diary study (Study 2; <i>N</i> = 742 individuals, <i>n</i> = 2774 days). As hypothesized, designing fun and designing competition promote work engagement, while designing fun decreases workaholism, and designing competition increases it. We also found support for the configurational hypotheses. Namely, work engagement is especially high when employees enact playful work design congruently, and workaholism decreases when employees design fun more often than they design competition. Taken together, these findings underscore the paradoxical nature of playful work design: the same strategies that energize employees can also either fuel or prevent maladaptive overinvestment, depending on how they are orchestrated. The findings have important implications for research and practice.</p>","AI/Technology, Motivation",10.1007/s10869-025-10091-y

Through a two-wave survey (Study 1), a scenario-based experiment (Study 2), and a quasi-field experiment (Study 3), we find that when cooperative goal interdependence is high, colleagues tend to attribute personal initiative to organizational concern and actively share knowledge. In contrast, when cooperative goal interdependence is low, colleagues are more likely to attribute personal initiative to impression management and share knowledge only when explicitly requested. Our research thus introduces an attribution perspective on the interpersonal effects of proactive behavior and offers valuable guidance for managing proactive behavior in organizations.</p>","AI/Technology, Compensation/Benefits, Organisational Development & Design",10.1007/s10869-025-10090-z

However, although the cyclical relationship between precarity and health and well-being has been established by existing work, the underlying mechanisms that funnel marginalized workers into this cycle are not well understood. To address this gap, we introduce a theoretical framework—the Cycle of Precarious Work—that integrates psychological and sociological perspectives to explain how occupational segregation emerges and persists as a driver of this cycle. Using the Latino experience as an example, we conducted an integrative literature review and identified 124 relevant studies to develop our framework. Our review revealed that (a) the bias against Latino workers is associated with occupational segregation in labor markets; (b) occupational segregation entails more Latino workers being employed in precarious work; (c) Latino workers with intersecting identities (e.g., gender or immigration status) are more vulnerable to precarious employment; (d) precarious work has serious short- and long-term health effects; and (e) these adverse health outcomes in turn exacerbate workers’ precarity and strain, fueling a self-reinforcing cycle. Taken together, our framework elucidates how structural inequalities and biased perceptions push stigmatized workers into precarious employment from which they struggle to escape. Our work is the first to integrate underlying psychological and sociological mechanisms that cause occupational segregation and to offer individual and contextual factors that may exacerbate or buffer these relationships.</p>","AI/Technology, Diversity/Inclusion, Organisational Development & Design, Wellbeing",10.1007/s10869-025-10084-x
